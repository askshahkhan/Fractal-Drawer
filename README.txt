Contributions:
Separately completed 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 classes and methods and compared it to each other.
Ahmed worked on the math for the rectangle fractal and Akshay worked on the math for the circle fractal and the triangle fractal.
Both of us discussed and wrote the recursive code for rectangle, triangle, circle and code for totalArea

How to compile and run our program:
Type in javac FractalDrawer.java
Type in java FractalDrawer
You will be prompted to enter which shape you would like to draw.
Type in “rectangle”, “circle”, or “triangle”.
The total area of the fractal will be printed out
The Canvas window will appear. However, make sure to maximize the screen to see the full fractal.

Assumptions:
We’re assuming that the user will type in “rectangle”, “circle”, or “triangle” in its full text and not as “r”, “c”, or “t” or any other form.

Additional features:
NONE

Any bugs or defects:
There are no bugs or defects
